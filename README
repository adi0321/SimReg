SimReg
---------------------
SimReg : A novel Simulated Regression based algorithm for transcriptome quantification.
To solve the problem of transcript and gene expression level estimation from RNA-Seq
data, we proposed SimReg, a Monte-Carlo simulated regression based method, that uses
a more accurate simulation of read emission. 

To compile SimReg, simply run
